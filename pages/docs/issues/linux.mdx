## Sudo was run by a process that has the `no new privileges` flag set

```shell
The "no new privileges" flag is set, which prevents sudo from running as root.
If sudo is running in a container, you may need to adjust the container configuration to disable the flag.
```

1. 检查 `mihomo` 内核 owner
2. 检查 `apt` log 中是否报 `Warning: [YOUR_INSTALLATION_PATH] is performed unsandboxed`
